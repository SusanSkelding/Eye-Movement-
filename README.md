# Eye-Movement-Exercise

	This fun and exciting exercise features a pair of eyes that synchronously follow the cursor as it moves across the page. 
  
## how to use:

Clone the files to your local machine and open them in your prefered code editor where you can preview the working set of eyes. 

## Future plans

I would like to play around with the coding a bit more to make the eyes go crossed as the cursor moves between them.
